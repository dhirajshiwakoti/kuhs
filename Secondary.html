            <h3>Nepali</h3>
            Nepali is one of the key subjects in KUHS, being compulsory from class 1 to class 10. The Nepali department has set the following objectives to develop the standard of Nepali language, literature and communication skills:
            <ul>
                <li>To make the Nepali curriculum contextual</li>
                <li>To transfer knowledge to learners bearing in mind the requirements for entering higher education</li>
                <li>To enable learners to acquire grammatical skills through activity-based learning</li>
                <li>To encourage vocabulary acquisition and creative writing development</li>
                <li>To initiate discussion on cultural, economic, and social issues</li>
                <li>To enrich the teaching of Nepali by keeping up to date with new methods</li>
            </ul>
        
            <br><br>
        
            <h3>English</h3>
            In the Nepalese context the commonly used evaluation method is taking paper and pencil examinations either four times or three times a year, and the final one has the highest weight. Students get 75% written and 25% listening and speaking test in Secondary English. KUHS adopts more student-centred approaches such as assessing marks from coursework, homework, organization, presentation, participation and overall effort.
        
            KUHS students read a variety of English literature from Shakespeare to post-modern writers to enrich their logic, creativity and skills.
        
            <br>
            <strong>By the end of Secondary School, KUHS students should:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Achieve higher grades in IELTS, TOEFL, A-Levels and other national and international examinations</li>
                <li>Possess standard spoken English</li>
                <li>Be able to produce sound discussion essays</li>
                <li>Be able to use imaginative and innovative ideas</li>

            </ul>
        
            <br><br>
        
            <h3>Science</h3>
            Science classes play an important role in helping students acquire scientific knowledge, logical thinking, and analytical skills. KUHS uses the following methodologies to enhance learning:
        
            <ul>
                <li>Activities</li>
                <li>Demonstrations</li>

            <br><br>
        
            <h3>Mathematics</h3>
            Mathematics helps students develop logical thinking, problem-solving skills, communication, generalizations, and creativity. To improve learning outcomes, KUHS implements the following strategies:
        
            <h4>Learning Methodology</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Students learn in pairs within groups and explain concepts to each other.</li>
                <li>Each student solves problems based on worked-out examples and helps others as needed.</li>
                <li>Partners are rotated to allow each student to be both learner and teacher.</li>
                <li>Use of concrete (objects), semi-concrete (figures), and symbolic (notations) teaching materials.</li>
                <li>Evaluation based on skills, understanding, and problem-solving.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <br><br>
        
            <h3>Social Studies</h3>
            Social Studies helps students understand human life, societal structures, institutions, culture, and global interrelations. The aim is to develop sincere, patriotic and socially responsible citizens.
        
            <strong>Teaching Methods:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Role play, community work, field-trips, hiking and observation</li>
                <li>Group discussions and follow-up activities</li>
                <li>Use of maps, globes, print and digital media</li>
                <li>Teacher as facilitator to spark creative ideas</li>
            </ul>
        
            <strong>Evaluation:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Based on knowledge, understanding, practical and research skills</li>
                <li>Focus on critical thinking and positive values</li>
                <li>Preparation of in-house projects aligned with academic goals</li>
            </ul>
        
            <br><br>
        
            <h3>Environment, Population and Health (EPH)</h3>
            EPH education extends beyond schools to families and communities. Teaching is interactive and student-centered.

                <li>Encouraging critical thinking through challenging topics</li>
            </ul>
        
            <strong>Evaluation:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>60% from daily class and homework performance</li>
                <li>40% from written exams</li>
                <li>Students also evaluated on attitudes and engagement</li>
            </ul>
        
            <br><br>
        
            <h3>Computing</h3>
            As computers are an integral part of life and work, KUHS emphasizes the development of practical, adaptable computing skills.
        
            <strong>Key Learning Goals:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Effective use of PCs, Internet, and databases</li>
                <li>Problem-based learning and project development</li>
                <li>Adaptability to future technological changes</li>
            </ul>
        
            The curriculum is fluid and flexible to meet the demands of a dynamic digital world.
